### **How to Split a Claim**

For claims requiring division into multiple related claims, Qantev provides a manual claim splitting workflow:

1. **Initiate Split Workflow:**
Click "Split Claim" in the footer of the claim details page. The split modal opens, prompting you to specify how many split claims you want to create.

2. **Assign Documents:**
Review all uploaded documents for the claim. Assign each document to the appropriate split claim. You can choose documents to ensure they are linked to the correct new claim.

3. **Field Duplication:**
When a claim is split, Qantev duplicates all fields and all candidate field values from the original claim to every new split claim. This means each resulting claim will initially contain the same set of fields and candidate values as the original.

4. **Document Assignment:**
Documents are assigned to split claims exactly as specified by the user during the workflow.

5. **Status Update:**
After confirming the split, the original claim's status is updated to "Split." Each new claim created through splitting will appear in the claims list and must be processed individually.

6. **Webhook Notification:**
A claim_split webhook event is sent to configured endpoints, notifying external systems of the split operation.
